1.1If you want to create a production build of the code, you have to run in the console the following command:
`node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack-production.config.js -p`.

1.2Then you don't have to start the `webpack-dev-server`. You have to use anothe server, for example "serve" or "http-server".
The code will be minimized and stripped.

1.3You can start the 'http-server' with the command `npm run startProd`.
